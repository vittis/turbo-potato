An ability can be an [[Attack]] or a [[Spell]]. 

A unit can have many abilities. All abilities have independent cooldowns.

The cooldown is affected by [[Attack Cooldown Modifier]] or [[Spell Cooldown Modifier]] depending of  its type.

# Weapon Ability

Refers to the ability granted by a weapon, that is, a Weapon Attack or Weapon Spell. 

When using an ability that instructs you to do a Weapon attack, like [[Powershot]], if the character is equipped with two weapons, only the main weapon will be used to trigger the attack. The secondary weapon will not be utilized for this particular ability.
