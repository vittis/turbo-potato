Similar to [[Attack]], a Spell is an active ability which has a cooldown. The cooldown is affected by [[Spell Cooldown Modifier]].

All active abilities have independent cooldowns.

Attacks can be obtained through various sources, like [[Weapon]], [[Class]], [[Race]],  [[Talent]] and [[Perk]].

Example Spells:
- [[Reinforce Allies]], obtained by being a [[Blacksmith]]
- [[Summon Crab]], obtained in the [[Ranger]] talent tree
