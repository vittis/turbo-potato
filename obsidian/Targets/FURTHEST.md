The furthest enemy unit.

The opposite of [[STANDARD]]. To determine which unit is furthest, is prioritized furthest column then different row, in the following pattern:
1- Check the furthest column with enemy units.
2- If the other row has an unit, it is the target. If not, it's the same row's unit.
